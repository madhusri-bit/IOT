✅ CASE STUDY – EXPERIMENT 1
Study and Configuration of Arduino Uno

(Minimum 3 pages in simple language)

⭐ 1. Introduction

Arduino Uno is one of the most popular microcontroller boards used in IoT and embedded projects. It is very easy to use and helps beginners understand electronics, programming, and hardware. In this experiment, we learn how to install Arduino IDE, connect the board, and verify the working of Arduino Uno.

)

⭐ 2. Objective (Aim)

To study the Arduino Uno board, understand its components, and verify the successful installation and working with the Arduino IDE.

⭐ 3. Components Required

(From the manual, page 11 

23ITC01-Iot Laboratory Manual F…

)

Arduino Uno

USB cable

Power adapter

Off-board LED

Jumper wires

PC with Windows OS

⭐ 4. Description of Arduino Uno

Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has:

14 Digital I/O pins (page 12)

6 Analog input pins – A0 to A5

1 USB port

1 Power jack

On-board LED on pin 13

According to Page 11–12 

23ITC01-Iot Laboratory Manual F…

, the board also contains:

Reset button

Voltage regulator

ICSP header

External power pins

Arduino can be powered through USB or a 9–12V adapter.

⭐ 5. Installation Steps

(From page 13 of manual 

23ITC01-Iot Laboratory Manual F…

)

Install Arduino IDE from the official website.

Connect the Arduino board with a USB cable.

Install necessary drivers.

Open Arduino IDE.

Select the correct board (“Arduino Uno”).

Select the COM port.

Open the Blink example.

Upload and verify proper working.

⭐ 6. Working of the Blink Program

When we upload the blink program:

void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  delay(1000);
}


Pin 13 LED turns ON for one second and OFF for one second.

This proves the Arduino is installed and working properly.

⭐ 7. Result

Thus, the study and configuration of Arduino Uno was completed, and the basic LED blinking program verified correct installation.
