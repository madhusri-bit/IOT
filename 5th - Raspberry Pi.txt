✅ CASE STUDY – EXPERIMENT 5
Study and Configuration of Raspberry Pi

(3 pages in easy English)

⭐ 1. Introduction

Raspberry Pi is a small, powerful computer that can run an operating system like Linux. Unlike Arduino or NodeMCU, Raspberry Pi is a full single-board computer with USB ports, HDMI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPIO pins. In IoT, it is used for advanced applications like AI, camera projects, cloud servers, and automation.

)

Raspberry Pi 3 B+

HDMI to VGA adapter

Power supply (5V)

LED

DHT11 sensor

Connecting wires

⭐ 4. Specifications of Raspberry Pi 3 B+

(Page 56–57 

23ITC01-Iot Laboratory Manual F…

)

64-bit quad-core CPU @ 1.4 GHz

1 GB RAM

Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi dual band

4 USB ports

HDMI output

40-pin GPIO header

MicroSD-based OS

It is more powerful than Arduino or NodeMCU.

⭐ 5. GPIO Pin Explanation

(Page 57 

23ITC01-Iot Laboratory Manual F…

)

Total pins: 40

Usable GPIO pins: 26

Supports:

Digital I/O

I2C

SPI

UART

These GPIO pins can control LEDs, sensors, motors, etc.

⭐ 6. Basic Python Programs
Task 1: Blink an LED

(Page 58)

gpio.setmode(gpio.BOARD)
gpio.setup(11, gpio.OUT)

while True:
    gpio.output(11, gpio.HIGH)
    sleep(1)
    gpio.output(11, gpio.LOW)
    sleep(1)


This makes the LED blink ON and OFF.

Task 2: Button Controlled LED

(Page 58)

GPIO.setup(7, GPIO.IN)
GPIO.setup(11, GPIO.OUT)

while True:
    if GPIO.input(7) == True:
        GPIO.output(11, GPIO.HIGH)

Task 3: DHT11 Temperature Reading

(Page 60)

This reads humidity and temperature using a Python library.

⭐ 7. Result

(Page 60 result
